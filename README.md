# quizNERD

## Description

This page was built to determine who is the Nerdiest Nerd of all time. This is accomplished via a quiz on my favorite Nerd topics. Your goal is to race the time and collect as many points as possible. For each correct answer, you earn 5 points. For every incorrect answer, however, you lose 3 seconds from your remaining time.

## Tech Used

This page was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Icebox

I will be adding more questions, and question randomization in future development.

## Application Link

The link to the deployed site is - https://afarr002.github.io/quizNERD/
